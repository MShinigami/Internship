# Creating project of name First_Project using terminal:


django-admin startproject Project_name

# if showing "django-admin" not recognized internal or external command - error
# then we need to run below command:

python -m django startproject Project_Name or

py -m django startproject Project_Name  or

python3 -m django startproject Project_Name

    #     asgi.py
    #     settings.py
    #     urls.py
    #     wsgi.py

# These are default files and folder which created by django framework

# Run the Django Project on Browser before that you need to enter in that project Name using:
# On Terminal type : 
cd Project_Name

# and then you can run project

# On Terminal type : 
python manage.py runserver
or
py manage.py runserver
or
python3 manage.py runserver

# default project name app is created where settings.py file available and urls.py also

# Now look MVT Architecture - request first goes to URL then -> Views then -> Templates (Design)

# Now Open default app urls.py file, where you can see if it is blank path by user then there is NO Home.urls (Home is app name - case sensitive) calling and therefore we need to call Home.urls and that page name as:

# we need to import include module and then use in urls.py file of default app

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('website.urls')),
]

# and now you can create app with name Home and in that Home app create urls.py and copy default app urls.py into urls.py of Home app (which you create)
